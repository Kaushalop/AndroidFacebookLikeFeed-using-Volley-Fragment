AndroidFacebookLikeFeed-using-Volley-Fragment
=============================================

This is an implementation of the Code given by Ravi Tamada at www.androidhive.info into fragments.

The Existing Code is an Activity and since people were having problems implementing in into Fragments so i shared.

The Original Code : http://www.androidhive.info/2014/06/android-facebook-like-custom-listview-feed-using-volley/

Just Copy the FeedActivityFragment to the MainActivity and call the fragment using snippet in FragmentCaller
